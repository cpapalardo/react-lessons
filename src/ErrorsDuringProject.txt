problem:
installed Radium 'using npm install --save radium'
the installation deleted babel eslint and node scripts

solution:
reran npm install and npm install babel-eslint --save-dev
restarted editor

problem:
eslint throwing errors for props validation, 
which I don't care for during the earlier lessons

solution:
on the "rules" section of my eslintrc.json, added
"react/prop-types": "warn"
reran npm start
might look into eslint-plugin-react, recommended on eslint website

problem: after creatng withClass function and using it as
higher order component, kept getting the error:
"Component definition is missing display name react/display-name"

solution:
on the "rules" section of eslintrc.json, added
"react/display-name": "off"
the same as "react/display-name": 0
reran npm start
